#Demandbase / Optimizely Integration

#Native Integration
Demandbase has partnered with Optimizely to provide native integration.  This integration is now available as a native feature for *Optimizely Enterprise* subscribers.

For additional information see:
* Solution Overview: https://www.optimizely.com/partners/technology/demandbase/
* Setup Guide: https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/204009240-Integrating-Optimizely-with-Demandbase

#Manual Integration

*Optimizely Starter* subscribers can use Demandbase within Optimizely *Audiences* and for driving personlized content. 

This basic HTML file demonstrates how to use the [Demandbase JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/demandbaselabs/demandbaselabs/tree/master/JavaScriptSDK) with Optimizely.

There are two ways to use Demandbase within Optimizely.

1. Trigger an Optimizely Experiment based on a Demandbase Segment
2. Place a visitor in an Optimizely Visitor Segment based on a Demandbase Segment

#Prerequisites
1. Install the Optimizely tracking code as instructed in the 'Implementation' tab in Optimizely
2. Configure and install the [Demandbase JS SDK](https://github.com/demandbaselabs/demandbaselabs/tree/master/JavaScriptSDK)
  * Your Demandbase Solutions Consultant will assist you with this step.

#Create Optimizely Visitor Segments
Optimizely Visitor Segments allow you to dissect the results of an experiment based on visitor attributes.
To get started, first create Visitor Segments in the Optimizely dashboard.  See [Managing Visitor Segments from the Dashboard](https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200040865-Managing-Visitor-Segments-from-the-Dashboard) for detailed instructions on how to setup Visitor Segments.

*Note: Custom visitor segments are only available in [Optimizely Platinum](https://www.optimizely.com/pricing).*

The two methods described here are not mutually exclusive.  It is possible to add a single visitor to both dynamic segments and pre-defined segments during the same visit.

##Creating Dynamic Segments
Sending Demandbase company profile attributes to the [Optimizely API](https://www.optimizely.com/docs/api#visitor-segments) you can dynamically add a visitor to a segment.
This provides additional granularity in reporting on experiment results by providing detailed information about the visitor's company profile.

Dynamically add a visitor to a segment in the `__db.callback` function.

For example:
```
  __db.callback = function(company) {
    window.optimizely = window.optimizely || [];
    //dynamically add visitor to a segment
    window['optimizely'].push(['addToSegment', 'Industry', Demandbase.Segments.CompanyProfile.industry]);

    //add a visitor to multiple segments
    window['optimizely'].push(['addToSegment', 'RevenueRange', Demandbase.Segments.CompanyProfile.revenue_range]);

    //trigger experiment
    window.optimizely.push(['activate', 'EXPT1_ID_HERE']);
  };
```
In this example, the API identifier for each segment ('Industry' and 'RevenueRange') is found in the Optimizely dashboard.

##Add a Visitor to a Pre-Defined Segment
Match your Demandbase Content Module Segments to your Optimizely Visitor Segments by creating custom segments in the Optmizely dashboard.  This method is useful for analyzing broad-based, well-defined target segments.

1. Create a new Visitor Segment.
2. Select *Satisfy this custom Javascript condition*
3. Place a reference to a Demandbase Segment in the text box.  For example: `Demandbase.Segments.YourSegmentName`.
  * See your Demandbase code for your configured Demandbase Segments.
4. To use your Visitor Segment, view the results of an experiment, then select your Custom Segment from the menu on the left.
  * Visit [Visitor Segments](https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200040315-Visitor-Segments) for more on using Visitor Segments to analyze results.

Whether using dynamic segments or pre-defined segments, a returning visitor will maintain segments across visits (assuming they do not clear their cookies).  Once created, segments are available to all experiements.

#Trigger an Optimizely Experiment
Triggering an Optimizely Experiment using Demandbase allows you to personalize and target website content based on a visitor's company profile.
Multiple experiments can be setup and triggered according to various Demandbase Segments.  This works best when the Demandbase Segments do not overlap.

See [Visitor Condition Targeting](https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200039685-Visitor-Condition-Targeting) for further detail on using Optimizely.

1. Create a new experiment with at least one variation
2. Under the Options menu, select *Targeting*
  * **Option 1:** Select *Are in any of these segments*
    * A visitor must already be part of a segment when using this option.  See [Create Optimizely Visitor Segments](https://github.com/demandbaselabs/demandbaselabs/tree/master/Optimizely#create-optimizely-visitor-segments) for instructions.
    * This is the best approach for targeting visitors *after the first page view*, and it will not impact the visitor experience.
    * When Targeting in this manner, you do not need to specify the experiment ID to activate the experiement.   For example: `window.optimizely.push(['activate']);`
  * **Option 2:**  Select *Satisfy this custom JavaScript condition*.
    * Place a reference to a Demandbase Segment in the text box.  For example: `Demandbase.Segments.YourSegmentName`
    * See your Demandbase code for your configured Demandbase Segments.
    * **Note:** This approach enables targeting visitors on their *first page view*, however visitors may see content "change" or "flash" when the experiment is triggered.
3. Set the [Activation Mode](https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200039765-Activation-Mode) to *Manual*.
4. Place the experiment activation code within the Demandbase `callback` function.
  * Example:
  ```
  __db.callback = function(company) {
    window.optimizely = window.optimizely || [];
    window.optimizely.push(['activate', 'EXPT1_ID_HERE']);
    window.optimizely.push(['activate', 'EXPT2_ID_HERE']);
    window.optimizely.push(['activate', 'EXPTn_ID_HERE']);
  };
  ```
  *Note: the experiment ID is typically an integer, not a string.*
5. *Optional:* Adjust the [Traffic Allocation](https://help.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/200040115-Traffic-Allocation) in Optimizely to use the variation more frequently.

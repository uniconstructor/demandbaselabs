#Adobe Data Connector
The **current best approach** is to use the native *Data Connector* available within the Adobe Analytics Admin console.

Under the main *Adobe Marketing Cloud* menu, select *Data Connectors*, then choose *Demandbase* (listed in the *Other* category).

The Data Connector is a simple 5-step wizard that enables the integration of up-to 16 Demandbase company profile attributes using only 2 Conversion Variables (eVars).

If more company profile attributes are desired, a JavaScript solution is available to add more attributes via a 3rd Conversion variable.

##Prerequisites
Requires Adobe Analytics platform 15 and s_code version H25.5 or higher (or AppMeasurement JS).

See [Integration Prerequisites](http://microsite.omniture.com/t2/help/en_US/connectors/demandbase/#Integration_Prerequisites) for additional prerequisites.

##Deployment
Installing the integration involves placing the generated JavaScript within your `AppMeasurement.js` (or `s_code.js`).
If the *Integrate* module is not already part of your `s_code.js` you must add this as well.
The *Integrate* module is not required if using App Meaurement JS.

The `example_s_code.js` provided here shows where to place these two blocks of JS:

1. Demandbase plugin generated by the Data Connector wizard
2. [Integrate Module](http://microsite.omniture.com/t2/help/en_US/connectors/demandbase/#Including_the_Integrate_Module)

See the [complete deployment guide](http://microsite.omniture.com/t2/help/en_US/connectors/demandbase/#Deploying_the_Integration) within the Adobe Analytics in-product documentation.
